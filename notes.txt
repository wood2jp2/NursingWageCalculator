Goal of this project:
    - help nurses more accurately calculate the wages they can expect in their bi-weekly check, since unfortunately mistakes are made in the current process. 
        + This can give the nurse a better idea if they need to reach out to get wages corrected.

Technologies: 
    1. Django
    2. React
    3. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

Crafting the Django backend:
    - Using the pipenv package, we can start up a virtual environment in the directory with 'pipenv shell'
        + This assumes that you have pipenv installed (pipenv install)
    - We installed multiple packages: 'pipenv install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-jwt django-cors-headers'
    - started up wagecalculator project in the backend folder with 'django-admin startproject [project_name] [directory]'
    - Modified the settings.py file by adding two installed apps and one value for cors middleware.
    - Added a cors_origin_whitelist dictionary as well as a REST_FRAMEWORK one.
    - Added an authentication route to urls.py
    - Then we migrated with 'python manage.py migrate'
    - Created user to test authentication: 'python manage.py createsuperuser'
        + 'jwood' || 4esz$ESZ$ESZ
    - Start up server with 'python manage.py runserver'
        + Our back end runs on Port 8000.
        + If you go to http://localhost:8000/admin, you can now log in with those credentials.
    - At http://localhost:8000/token-auth/, you can log in and actually view the token you get back on successful log in.
        + We will also need to set up for users to sign up using Django's built-in User model.
    - So remember, within each django project, it consists of multiple applications.
        + For signing up, we need to create an application because we will need to display a sign up view.
        + 'python manage.py startapp [name_of_app]'
        + Then add the app to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the settings.py file.
    - Now we need to serialize/unserialize the User class into and out of various formats (JSON)
        + We created a serializers.py file in the application with two separate serializers.
        + When the user signs up first time, we create the account and send back the username in the successful response. 
            - We don't need this response when the user does not sign up for the first time, so hence two serializers.

    - After taking a break, I re-initialized the virtual machine and started it up by first changing to the 'backend' directory, then running 'pipenv shell' to activate the virtual environment.
        + Lastly, run 'python manage.py runserver'
    - We added to the core>views.py file.
        + We will have two views, one for existing users (current_user) and one for new users signing up through the form.
    - We then add a new urls.py file to the core app.
        + Each app has it's own urls.py file for routing configuration
        + Import them, then add urls with views they are to deliver. It appears that class-based views need to be used with the .as_view() method.
            > You don't need to define .as_view() since it should be coming from inheriting from APIView
    - Following, we hook up the core/urls.py file to our project urls.py file.
    
    - Next, we need to allow users to get their data related to their account when they sign in.
        + First we added a utils.py file to our project.
        + Then we imported our UserSerializer into it, and created a custom function to return the data in a dictionary on the 'user' field.
        + This becomes our default with a JWT_AUTH dictionary added to our settings.py file.

    NOTE: In python, you basically access files with dot notation, and any variables, functions, or classes within. 

    Tomorrow I will set this up with React.
